I am an undergraduate student of computer science in Zhejiang University. I am currently at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</a> advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/">Cho-Jui Hsieh</a> and <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Kai-Wei Chang</a> conducting experiments about adversarial attack problem. Previously, I followed <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IIoFY90AAAAJ">Zhou Zhao</a> at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a> doing research about various NLP problems. I will join Natural Language Computing Group of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research, Asia (MSRA)</a> at October 2019 as a research intern. My research interests include general machine learning, natural language processing and adersarial attack & robustness of machine learning models.
